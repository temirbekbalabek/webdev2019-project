We want to create a gym website where you can use your test to determine your body type, get a recommendation on how to eat right, sign up for a trainer and get a subscription. In addition, the site will be information with the technique of the exercise.
Professional fitness trainers will help you choose a program that is ideal for your level of training, will calculate the load and carefully follow to ensure that your classes in the gym were held in a safe mode. With the help of our site you can see the layout of the hall and find out what equipment there are.
